A strong personal brand is a full package wrapped into one, where you can find how a company functions, what a company stands for, how a business supports their clients, its values and how the company projects it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may seem like a lot of information and hard to organize and put together, and that is why I am going to guide you with these questions that you will need to know before building one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Why do You do What You do and What Inspired this Passion?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><b>Stay authentic and true to yourself! <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step to give an effective and clear message to your audience is by digging deep into why you started your business in the first place. You should be able to answer this question easily and share the value of why following this passion fulfills you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from making a steady income you also need to find enjoyment in the business and the work you will be doing, or you will find\u00a0 yourself questioning the money, time, and energy that you are investing in it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. What do You Offer That&#8217;s Different or Unique?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><b>Stand out from the rest!<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Add a long-lasting and unique value to your service or product by providing\u00a0 your clients with something they consider one of a kind and\/or different from the rest.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The business world is a competitive place and you have to establish what you will bring to the table from the beginning, and why it is the best option for your ideal clients. You should try and make this as obvious as possible in your branding!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. How would you describe your typical customer or client?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><b>Know your audience<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">! This one is without a doubt one of the most important keys to building a successful business. The more you understand your clients, the easier your job will be. The decision you make will align with their needs and wants perfectly. This is especially important in order to attract, engage, and connect efficiently with your target audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. What three core values do you want your brand to encompass?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allow yourself to <\/span><b>show some<\/b> <b>vulnerability<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the top 3 values on how you want your audience to feel and identify with you and your brand?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humans are driven by emotions and when you start to connect with your target clients through feelings you will start creating deep, meaningful, and loyal customer-client relationships.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be aware and make sure to describe every one of these three values that you know you can provide consistently and effortlessly in all your service stages. These must be genuine values that you and your employee&#8217;s live and breathe every day of your life without falling into the trap of pretending to be what you are not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To give you an example:<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you present your brand as fun and outgoing on social media, make sure that your clients perceive you and your employees as fun and outgoing people. You don\u2019t want to create a fake illusion of your brand and then disappoint your target by selling them a\u00a0 service that doesn\u2019t match the core values of your company.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loyal clients don\u2019t stay with you just because they receive a good quality service from you, they give you their fidelity by how you make them feel and how much they feel identified with you along the journey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. What do you want your new branding to accomplish?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><b>Create a Magnetic Message<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one that is relevant enough and provides real value to your clients by showing them that you can help them to move from their challenges to get results.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consistent and being repetitive are the two main characteristics that your message should have to create visibility, attraction, and engagement with your targets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. What are a few big goals you have for your business?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><b>Make a list of your goals<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and use them as objectives to reach in the short, medium, and long term. Lists are a great way to not lose track of your main purpose and to stay motivated by taking baby steps every day until you accomplish it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. What do you want your new branding to avoid?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><b>Make a process of elimination<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Most of the time it\u2019s hard to define our identity or a brand without an entire level of certainty, however, you can always take the easiest path by defining what you don\u2019t want for your brand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you eliminate all the things that push you away from your identity, you will stop wasting your time by getting rid of all the excess\u00a0 and start focusing on the things that will make your brand a real and genuine one.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And to help you get started you can download my <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/kelleynicoledesigns.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Brand-Questionnaire-Kelley-Nicole-Designs.pdf\">free discovery questionnaire<\/a><\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>.<\/strong> It contains all of these questions in a PDF document that is easy to fill in.
