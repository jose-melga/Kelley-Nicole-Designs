Defining all of the essential elements of your company is a prior step to have a strong base that keeps it aligned with the rest of the elements. For example, before picking and designing all your marketing efforts (packages, POP materials, letterheads, Flyers, etc.) be sure that you have defined the most important design element before anything else: Your Logo!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What is a logo?<\/b><b><br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A logo is the principal element that identifies your company. It can be made up out of texts (names), images (trademarks), shapes (symbols), or a combination of the three that shows what a company does and what the brand values.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Why are they important?<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Logos are the\u00a0<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">face of your company!<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These elements of design are the few seconds that your brand has to make a solid first impression with your target potential clients.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It helps you to build a strong\u00a0<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brand identity<\/span><\/i><b>\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by keeping your message consistent and repetitive without losing the essence of your business.<\/span><b>\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A well-designed logo turns out to be a\u00a0<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smart Strategic Tool\u00a0<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by helping your brand with the following:\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standing out from the competition.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generate and Increase\u00a0Brand Recognition<\/span><b>,<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> how many years have brands like Apple, Coca-Cola, Facebook, or Nike have been in your mind for the uniqueness of their logos?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generate and Foster\u00a0Engagement\u00a0and\u00a0Brand Loyalty.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Components of a Logo<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are no official rules to follow when creating a logo, but there is a combination of elements that in most cases are going to build a timeless one.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Scale:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Synonym of \u201cSize\u201d. Just think about all those media channels where your brand can be placed and how wonderful it will be to see it perfectly understandable and fit in varied sizes. Make sure that yours is easily scalable and versatile.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Contrast:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It goes with a hand of an esthetic appeal, you don\u2019t want to see a logo full of colors if it is heavy for the view, hard to read, and to understand. Clean logos deliver clean messages.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Color<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Doing research is vital before you get excited and start deciding on colors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colors are the components that go beyond the rest of the elements because these are the communicators of your message and the ones that speak to your audience.\u00a0Understanding your target audience, the purpose of your company, and the meaning of each selected color will help you to precisely determine your color palette. Stick to one to three colors at the most for the best results.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose wisely as if you were to choose your brand new car because these colors will be an inherent element in all of your marketing efforts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Simplicity vs. Complexity<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Simplicity always seems to overpower complexity when it comes to logos. Simple logos are easy to remember and are more memorable. Try not to complicate yourself trying to show and communicate a lot of unnecessary information.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Figurative vs. Literal<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: It&#8217;s not a mystery that the most memorable logos are the ones that have a curious and relevant story\/meaning behind them without being too obvious in showing their product or service. Why? Because it makes them stand out of the arena of competition.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u00b4s imagine if Mac presented us a logo with the image of a computer instead of an apple. Would you still remember it? And the reason for that is that they took the extra mile by thinking outside the box, abstract and unique!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Format\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-Vector format will make your logo easily transformed in a variety of scales and formats. Live a simple life in vector format!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process of creating a logo for your business should be a creative and innovative experience. You should try to use this time to brainstorm not only the logo itself but also where you see yourself taking your business in the future, changing your logo later on down the road after your business has been started can be a very stressful and difficult process.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you would like help with the design of your logo, don\u2019t hesitate to ask.
