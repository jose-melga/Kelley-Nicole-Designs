And although it is true that both positions work towards bringing a website to life, the skills, preparation and training associated with each position are very different from one another.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While web designers are mainly focused on what the user actually sees on their computer screen and\/or mobile device, the web developer is mainly focused on governing all of the codes that make a website tick. Nowadays Google Analytics are searching for both web design companies and web development companies.These two terms are very interconnected to each other but they require two unique skill sets.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s take a look into more detail on some of the major roles and responsibilities of the two.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Web designers Vs. Website developers<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My husband and I played a perfect role in the development of this blog in the sense that I am the web designer in our business and he is the web developer. We both have very specific roles and responsibilities and with both of our skill sets combined together we are the perfect match and were able to create the business that we have today.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roles and Responsibilities:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s start off by talking about some of the roles and responsibilities of web designers and web developers. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Web designers must always begin by considering a client\u2019s website objectives and goals. Then they can move on to set a website\u2019s information hierarchy and help guide the design process. The design process not only includes the graphic designs of the website but can include the logo and branding designs as well. Next, web designers can start creating wireframes and finally move to the design stage. Web designers may use several basic design principles to achieve an aesthetically pleasing layout which also offers excellent user experience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A web developer is focused on the technical side of an application and\/or website and the development of the functionalities in a website and\/or applications. They specialize in coding and understand the language and framework within the coding systems. They need to have good analytical and logical skills in order to write efficient codes and to bring out usability into the applications.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The work of a web designer:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developing and designing company logos.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choosing and incorporating colors from brand color palettes.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developing graphic designs and choosing brand photography.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Designing wireframes for the website in Photoshop and\/or Illustrator.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developing the layout of the website and where the images are going to be put.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The work of a web developer:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and other relevant web design coding languages for efficient web development.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating and testing applications for the website.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining and updating the website when it is necessary.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connecting the domain name and setting up the hosting of a website.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Installing and creating website plug-ins.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developing mobile apps that work with the website.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should I hire a web designer, web developer or both to develop a website from the ground up?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many cases companies need to hire both a web designer and a web developer that can work together to create a high quality website. A reliable web team will have at least one developer and one designer who can work well together to make a website that matches the client\u2019s unique concerns. Web designers create the look of\u00a0 a website and other attributes but do not have the technical skills to make the designs come to life on the screen. A good web team has the expertise in designs, back end development and front end development to build the website from the very beginning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope this blog has helped you gain a better understanding of the main differences between a web designer and a web developer and the principal roles of the two.
